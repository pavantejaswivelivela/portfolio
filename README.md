# Human-AI design methods for Multifunctional bio-inspired innovation.
I am Pavan Tejaswi Velivela, a recent PhD graduate from McGill University, where I developed the **MBID ideation system**—a structured framework for rapidly generating multifunctional bio-inspired design concepts. My work bridges bioinspired morphology, mechanical engineering, and product design, with ongoing efforts to integrate generative AI to support human–AI collaborative ideation.

### Education
1. PhD in Mechanical Engineering - McGill University, Quebec, Canada (2020-24).
2. MSc in Design & Engineering - Politecnico di Milano, Lombardy, Italy (2016-18).
3. B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering - Koneru Lakshmaiah College of Engineering (KL deemed to be a University), Andhra Pradesh, India (2009-13).

### Research @ McGill University 
- Multifunctional Bio-inspired Design (MBID) **ideation system** comprises six key components :
1. **Identify**: Biological functional features
2. **Abstract & Map**: Low-level abstraction and mapping of biological functional features as morphology-tissue-function relationships. 
3. **Classify**: Classify the biological features based on their shared or common geometric characteristic, called Domains. (Domain Integrated Design (DID) & Expandable Domain Integrated Design (xDID))
4. **Visualise**: Visualise the knowledge database of the abstracted and classified biological features, called BIKAS (Bio-inspired Knowledge Acquisition and Simulacrum)
5. **Select**: Select the relevant biological features between those that exhibit the same function by using the quantitative parameters (Meta-level design parameters)
6. **Combine**: Combine different morphological features using the morphology matrix for generating multifunctional bio-inspired product concepts.
