# Biologically inspired conceptual design and engineering

Hi, I am Pavan Tejaswi Velivela, I have a Ph.D. from McGill University in Mechanical Engineering.
My thesis involves developing an ideation system for Multifunctional Bio-inspired Design (MBID).
On this page, you can access my latest projects and research. Additionally, there is one more online portfolio on Google Sites:

## Education
1. PhD in Mechanical Engineering - McGill University, Canada
2. MSc in Design and Engineering - Politecnico di Milano, Italy
3. B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering - Koneru Lakshmaiah College of Engineering (KL deemed to be University), India  

### Research @ McGill
- Novel of Bio-inspired Knowledge Acquisition and Simulacrum (BIKAS) a Knowledge Database.
