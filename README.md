# Biologically inspired conceptual design and engineering
I am Pavan Tejaswi Velivela, and I am currently at McGill University finishing my PhD on developing a rapid idea generation system for generating Multifunctional Bio-inspired Designs (MBID).
The outcome of the research is to enhance the rapidity in generating unique multifunctional designs/structures inspired by biological systems. I work at the intersection of Bioinspiration (morphology), Mechanical Engineering, Product Design & Engineering, and Generative AI (in progress)

### Education
1. PhD in Mechanical Engineering - McGill University, Quebec, Canada (2020-24).
2. MSc in Design & Engineering - Politecnico di Milano, Lombardy, Italy (2016-18).
3. B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering - Koneru Lakshmaiah College of Engineering (KL deemed to be a University), Andhra Pradesh, India (2009-13).

### Research @ McGill University (Online link: [MBID ideation system](https://pavantejaswivelivela.github.io/MBID-ideation-system/)
- Multifunctional Bio-inspired Design (MBID) Ideation System comprises :
1. Knowledge database: BIKAS (Bio-inspired Knowledge Acquisition and Simulacrum) Online interactive application Link: [BIKAS](https://bikas.onrender.com/)
2. Method for multifunctional bio-inspired design: Domain Integrated Design (DID)
3. Parameters for selecting between biological features that exhibit the same functions: Meta-level design parameters
4. Model for generating multifunctional bio-inspired designs: Expandable Domain Integrated Design (xDID)
5. Generation of novel multifunctional bio-inspired conceptual designs.

### Advanced multifunctional bio-inspired conceptual designs @ McGill University
